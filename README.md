## Usage

### PanelView
PanelView which provides Show & Hide behavior which can be instant or async and awaitable.

### AnimatedPanelView
References one or more IPanelAnimator components to control animate the Show & Hide of a panel. If you await the Show & Hide async methods

### PanelViewController
Controller for the display of a PanelView.

### PanelViewControllerBehaviour
A version of PanelViewController that is also a MonoBehaviour component that can be added to a game object.
Often you may want to set up & configure PanelViewControllers with data other than the panel type and using this class will allow you to do that in editor.

### PanelStackSystem
A scriptable object representation of a panel stack. Main purpose is in maintaining the navigation history of a menu. Push and Pop panel controllers onto this stack. If any PanelViewStackController component that subscribes to the PanelStackSystem will respond to the push and show/hide the corresponding panels. Generally the top PanelViewController on the stack is always visible.

### PanelViewStackController
A MonoBehaviour that references a PanelStackSystem. It responds to changes in the panel stack by getting the current showing and hiding controllers. It will then perform the necessary transitions.

### PanelViewControllerProvider
A scriptable object which services is a collection of PanelViewControllers. Generally you register PanelViewControllerBehaviour with a provider so that you can push them using the PanelPusher component. It also controls the location that views are parented to in the hierarchy.

### PanelViewControllerRegisterer
Add this component to a PanelViewControllerBehaviour to register the controller with a PanelViewControllerProvider instance.

### PanelType
Contains information about a panel and is used by the PanelViewController to locate the prefab and instantiate the PanelView.
